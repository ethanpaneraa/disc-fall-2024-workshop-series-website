title: About DISC
---

[DISC](https://sites.northwestern.edu/discnu/) was founded at Northwestern University in 2017 with the primary goal of expanding students' perceptions of how technology can be used for good. Every year, we build several software projects for local nonprofits and startups in the Evanston and Chicago communities. Recognizing the power of collaboration across difference, we look for the right balance of technical and non-technical skills when we assemble our project teams.

Our club consists of diverse and hardworking student leaders who want to make a positive impact on the world using modern technology. We challenge our members to grow as they work, building both hard and soft skills as they put on the hats of Product Managers, UI/UX designers, and Software Engineers.

As of Fall 2024, DISC has roughly 300 total members, many of whom have interned or are now working full-time at companies such as Google, Microsoft, Salesforce, Group One Trading, Splunk, Citadel, and other big tech companies and quant/trading firms.
