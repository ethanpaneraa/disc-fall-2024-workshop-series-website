title: Assignment 9 - Deployment and bonus features
---

_First, complete at least [assignment 4](/content/assignments/assignment-4) if you haven't already.
That assignment is prerequisite._

In this assignment, you will deploy your app so anyone can access it 
over the internet. How exciting! You'll be able
to send your friends your hosted URL and have them try out your app.

You'll also add a cool new thing to your code :D

## Core Requirements

1. Deploy your backend API using [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
    - Test this out by hooking it up to your frontend
    (replace the fetches to your localhost API URL with the new deployed URL).
2. Deploy your frontend using [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
    - Go to the deployed link, everything should work perfectly as expected!
3. Add one cool new thing to your app
    - Before you start, make sure to create a new branch for this assignment
      called `hw-9` that branches off the most recent version of your code. 
      Do all your work on this branch.
    - Your options are:
      - Use [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) to style your frontend.
      - Use [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style your frontend.
      - Use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) in your frontend.
        - You can technically migrate your backend API to TypeScript too, 
        but that's a bit more challenging.
      - Use a 3rd party API in your backend API.
        - In [workshop](/content/workshops/workshop-9), 
          we used the [github API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/quickstart?apiVersion=2022-11-28).
          Feel free to use this one.
        - You can choose any API you want as long as you are interfacing with it using
          network requests.
      - If your code *already* has any of these, that does not count. 
        You must add something new!

## Additional Requirements

- Add another cool thing to your app (another 3rd party API counts)
- For styled-components:
  - Implement conditional styling based on props
  - Implement media queries and/or CSS state effects like `:hover`, `:focus`, etc
  - Implement a CSS animation
  - Migrate ALL styles of your entire app to use styled-components
- For tailwind:
  - Add a [tailwind theme](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme) to your project
  - Migrate ALL styles of your entire app to use tailwind
- For TypeScript:
  - Implement and use an [enum](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html)
  - Migrate ALL files of your frontend app to use TypeScript instead of JavaScript
- For 3rd party APIs:
  - Use more functions provided by the API
  - Make multiple requests to the API from one of your endpoints
