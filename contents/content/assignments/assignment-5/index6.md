title: Assignment 6 - Performance & Maintainability
---

_First, complete at least [assignment 4](/content/assignments/assignment-4) if you haven't already.
That assignment is prerequisite;
it would be a poor use of time to learn about performance
and code maintainability if you aren't already familiar with React._

In workshop 6, we learned about how to optimize the performance of
your React app using new hooks, functions, and tricks with array states.
We also learned how to build readable, maintainable codebases.

In assignment 6, you’ll refactor your code to improve its maintainability
and deploy some tricks to optimize its performance.

## Setup

1. You’ll begin with your web app from assignment 5.
  If you did not do assignment 5, start with your web app from 
  assignment 4. If you didn't do that either, go do that first.

2. Navigate to your local project repository from assignment 5.
   Make sure you are on the `hw-5` branch
   (or whatever branch contains all your changes from assignment 5). 
   - Run `git branch` to check what branch you are on. 
   - Run `git checkout branch-name` to switch to a different branch.

3. Run `git checkout -b hw-6` to create a new branch called “hw-6” that
   branches off your hw-5 branch.
   **All of the work on your project MUST be done on this branch.
   You should NOT modify the main branch, or the branches of
   any previous assignments.**

4. Run `git push -u origin hw-6` to publish this new branch on github.

5. Dedicate one terminal window to running your code with npm.

   - Run `npm start` in this terminal to run your app and view your changes in the browser.
   - If you want to stop running your code at any time, use Ctrl+C inside this terminal.

6. Dedicate another terminal window to running normal terminal commands, like git commands.

   - `git add .` stages all of your current changes so you can commit them
   - `git status` displays your changes, showing what’s staged and what isn’t
   - `git commit -m “commit message here”` bundles everything on the stage into a commit
   - `git push` publishes your commit(s) to github

7. Now you are ready! Go forth and code!
   - As you progress on this assignment, continue grouping your changes into commits and
     pushing them to the hw-6 branch on github.
     All of your commits MUST be on the hw-6 branch, not the main branch or the branches
     of prevous assignments.

## Core requirements

- Performance
  - Every `.map` must use a key.
  - Every time a single element is added to an array, it must be added to the end.
  - Use at least one of [`useRef`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `React.memo`] to 
  improve the performance of your app.
    - If your usage does not either reduce the amount of work done per render, 
    or reduce the number of times a component needs to re-render,
    it does not count.
    - If these tools are used incorrectly, the performance will not improve. 
    Keep in mind how dependency arrays work and the persistence (or lack therof)
    of variables. Take note of what is a reference.
    - This is probably the least important of the core requirements.
- Maintainability
  - Refactor your code to have a neat and logical file organization. 
    - Each file should have limited responsibility.
    - Use subdirectories to organize groups of files.
  - Create and use 1 generic component.
  - Create and use 1 custom hook.

## Additional requirements

- Use more of these: [`useRef`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `React.memo`]. Again,
  ensure that each time you use one of these functions, it is actually effective in improving
  the performance of your app.
- Create more generic components and custom hooks. Try to eliminate redundancy, 
separate responsibilities, and abstract away implementation details as much as possible.
  - Don't overdo it though. Only abstract where it makes sense.
- Try out `useContext`.


## Tips

- When it comes to implementing performance optimizations, `console.log` is your best friend.
Use it to determine when a component has rerendered, what triggered the rerender, etc.
  - To that end, `useEffect` is also very helpful.
- Add comments to your code to help keep track of what exactly is a reference.
- When reorganizing your code, think about how long it would take for a
completely new set of eyes to understand what your code is doing.
You want to minimize that time.
- When it comes to readability & maintainability, make sure your decisions
are consistent. There is nothing worse than a codebase that looks like it is written 
by several different people (even if that is actually the case!).
- Don't worry if it's not perfect. Good is good enough.

## Submission

1. Make sure all your changes are committed and pushed onto github
   (the `hw-6` branch, NOT the main branch or any branches for previous assignments).
2. On github, make a pull request from your `hw-6` branch.
    - **Do NOT merge the pull request**
3. Once you've created the pull request, copy its URL from the browser.
4. Fill out [this google form](https://forms.gle/d2gjt5HFtBjZEUGb9)
