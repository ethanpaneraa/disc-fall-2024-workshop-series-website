## Workshop Topics

- **Setup**  
  Before starting, ensure your environment is ready for the workshop:

  - Charge your laptop and ensure all necessary software is installed:
    - Node.js
    - Git
    - VSCode
  - Start Zoom with the camera off, unmute yourself, and share your screen. Test audio to ensure it plays through your speakers and confirm attendees can hear you.
  - Share the Zoom link, slides, and attendance link via Discord and Zoom chat. Write the attendance link on the chalkboard.
  - Open slides, test microphones, and confirm any website updates are deployed.

- **Building Complex Backends**  
  This workshop introduces the principles of building robust, scalable backends used in industry. Weâ€™ll discuss architectural patterns, database management, and authentication.

  - **Industry-Grade Backends**:

    - Overview of complex backend systems using a simple architectural diagram.
    - Key components of industry-standard backend designs:
      - APIs: Load balancing, rate limiting, and gateways.
      - Data storage strategies: Caching with Redis, BLOB storage, and replication with multiple databases.
      - Microservices: The importance of separating concerns for scalability.
      - CDNs: Mentioned briefly for context (but not covered in detail).

  - **Complex Databases**:

    - Working with multiple tables, SQL joins, and grouping.
    - The importance of indexing for performance optimization.
    - ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers):
      - What they are and why they are useful.
      - Overview of common ORMs, with a focus on Supabase.
      - **Demo**: Using Supabase ORM to perform a SQL join.

  - **Authentication**:
    - Differentiating between authentication (verifying identity) and authorization (verifying permissions).
    - API gateways and their role in secure authentication.
    - Techniques for securing user data:
      - Encryption, decryption, hashing, and salting.
      - Sessions and JWT tokens (including refresh tokens).
      - Role-based authentication.
      - OAuth for third-party authentication.
    - Why using existing authentication services simplifies implementation:
      - Services like AWS Cognito, Firebase Auth, Supabase Auth, AuthJS, and Lucia Auth.
      - **Demo**: Implementing Supabase Auth for authentication.
