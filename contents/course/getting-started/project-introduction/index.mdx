## Social Connection Web Application

Project Leads: Amy Liao and Ethan Pineda (DISC Technical Leads)

### Problem Statement

Making new friends can be scary and challenging. Especially at Northwestern, where students come from around the globe with very diverse interests and experiences. For most, it’s their first extended time away from home, friends, and familiarity.

How do students navigate finding community and friendship on a campus of >8,000 while also facing difficult classes, uncomfortable living arrangements, and crappy dining hall food? Northwestern offers many imperfect solutions – roommates and dormmates, PA groups, student orgs, group homework assignments, campus events, frats, sororities, and the like. But the vast majority of people a student will meet won’t share their interests, background, or sense of humor. Finding a community where one feels like they truly belong remains a difficult task for Northwestern students.

That brings us to the primary concern of this project:

**How can we use software to streamline the search for social connection on college campuses?...**

Your task this quarter is to invent and build a web application that helps foster social connection on campus. This can be speficic to Northwestern, the Chicago-land area, or a more general approach to the problem

### Project Features

A part of our 9-week long workshop series, your web application will have the following features:

- The ability for students to make accounts and profiles
- The ability for students to view and filter the profiles of other - students by some criteria
- The ability for students to save the profiles of other students they are interested in connecting with, and view the profiles they saved
- Some way for connections in-app to become connections out-of-app

These feature requirements are intentionally left very broad. We leave it up to you to think about how you will implement these features in a way that fosters social connection. Feel free to be as creative, as out-there, as funny, or as serious as you want it to be.

### Inspiration and Sample Ideas

- Connect folks based on shared classes
- Connect folks based on their favorite memes
- Connect folks based on buzzfeed quiz results
- Implement a _literal_ dating app

### Project Goals

There are **four** primary goals we hope that you reach through the Fall 2024 DISC Workshop Series. Here they are:

1. Student get practice using the most popular web development tools (Figma, React, Node & Express)
2. Students get experience working on all parts of a technology stack (UI/UX, Frontend, Backend, CI/CD, & Deployment)
3. Students get a project that will look **great** on a resume
4. Students are prepared to execute on a high level during the 2024 Winter & Spring DISCover Program

### Project & Workshop Schedule

The goal is for this project to be designed, developed, and deployed gradually over the course of nine weeks in a sequence of 9 workshop and 'homework' assignments. Here is our _tenative_ schedule breakdown:

### Project Deadlines

Assignments will be released week-by-week during the workshop that they correspond with. For example, Assignment one will be released during Workshop one, Assignment 2 during Workshop 2, etc. etc.

**These are some guidelines to go for every project**:

1. If you wish to be considered for the DISCover program application, you **must** submit this project as part of your application. This means that ideally, your project **needs** to be finished by the time that DISCover applications are due. The current deadline is still in the works, but you can expect that it will be due sometime in the start of Wniter Quarter 2025

_Submitting all assignments demostrates commitment, which one of the most important facotrs in the DISCover application_

_Submitting good work demostrates technical competence, which is the second most important factor in the DISCover program application_

2. If you want feedback on your current progress, progress, or if you have any questions, comments, or concerns, you can reach out to either of the technical leads: [Ethan Pineda](mailto:EthanPineda2025@u.northwestern.edu) or [Amy Liao](mailto:AmyLiao2025@u.northwestern.edu)

_If you want feedback on a submission or project, you must do so within one week of it being assigned. Essentially, the project must be turned in before the start of the next workshop_

_**It is strongly recommended that you turn in your assignment by the one-week deadline**. This is because (1) you don't have to cram later and can enjoy your winter break and (2) you can improve your final submission for the DISCover program application based on feedback from DISC exec/the technical leads._

### Submission Logistics

Every assignment will have different submission instructions. Please be on the lookout for the assignment details, which will be released before every workshop
